## 2024-05-24 - Informative illustrations require descriptive alt text
**Learning:** In a repository primarily focused on documentation and organization profiles, the primary UX interactions are visual. Informative illustrations, such as the organization mascot, serve as key brand identifiers and should be accessible to screen reader users via descriptive alt text rather than being treated as purely decorative.
**Action:** Always check `<img>` tags in Markdown files for missing or empty `alt` attributes and provide meaningful descriptions that convey the purpose or content of the image.

## 2026-04-02 - Use semantic alert blocks for critical documentation disclaimers
**Learning:** Plain-text disclaimers in documentation can be easily overlooked. Converting these to semantic GitHub-native alert blocks (e.g., `> [!IMPORTANT]`) significantly improves visual hierarchy, scannability, and ensures that critical context is immediately apparent to all users, including those using assistive technologies.
**Action:** Identify plain-text call-to-actions or disclaimers in Markdown files and wrap them in the appropriate semantic alert block to enhance visibility and accessibility.

## 2026-04-10 - Follow GitHub Style Guide for informative illustration alt text
**Learning:** For a consistent and professional user experience, alt text for informative illustrations should follow the GitHub Style Guide. This specifies that the description should begin with "Illustration of..." and end with a period, ensuring clarity and standardized communication across the platform.
**Action:** When adding or updating alt text for informative images, ensure they follow the pattern "Illustration of [description]." to align with brand and accessibility standards.
